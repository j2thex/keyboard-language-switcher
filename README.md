# keyboard-language-switcher

## What is this?
This is a script, written by Jeffrey Smith 2016 in poor-poor apple script language.

Script switches keyboard layout of a 'q' variable from English to Russian, Russian to English

## How can it be used?
I use this script with alfred to switch keyboard layout of a selected word, something which puntoswitcher app does, but it's russian and I don't trust russians.'

## Known bugs
Capital letters are lowercased when switched.
